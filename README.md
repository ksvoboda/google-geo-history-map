# Google Geo History Map

Google Geo History Map is personal project of mine to show all recorded positions by Google Maps.


## Installation & usage

To use this project, just download or clone this repository and put "Location History.json" downloaded from your Google account to main directory. Then just launch the index.html file in your browser.


## Todo

- Fix showing locations in e.g. Great Britain (one digid before decimal)
- Distinguish activity (in vehicle, on foot, etc.)
- Info windows with all the informations
- Optional: Upload JSON file straight from the site (coding skills not required)
- Optional: Make the site public (only if previous point is done)
