# Google Geo History Map

Google Geo History Map is personal project of mine to show all recorded positions by Google Maps.

<b> Warning: </b> this is working only in northern hemisphere and eastern hemisphere, because Google is saving coordinates without decimal and I have to add it to work. In southern or western hemisphere, there's - and breaks the logic behind this program. (it will show posistion, but it is possible it will be somewhere else)


## Installation & usage

To use this project, just download or clone this repository and put "Location History.json" downloaded from your Google account to main directory. Then just launch the index.html file in your browser.


## Todo

- Fix showing locations in e.g. Great Britain (one digid before decimal)
- Distinguish activity (in vehicle, on foot, etc.)
- Info windows with all the informations
- Optional: Upload JSON file straight from the site (coding skills not required)
- Optional: Make the site public (only if previous point is done)
